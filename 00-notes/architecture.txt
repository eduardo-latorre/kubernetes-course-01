        - Controller: Detecs when Nodes go down and make decisions
        - Scheduler: Distributes the work across the Nodes 
- Node
    Components:
        - kubelet: Agent in every Node in the cluster makes sure the container are running 
        - Container Runtime: Underlying software that run
        s docker containers

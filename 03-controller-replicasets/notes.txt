ReplicationController & ReplicaSet:
- Can work with just one POD and start a new one if it fails
- Makes sure a number of replicas are up
- Scale up if demand increases

ReplicationController vs ReplicaSet
- ReplicaSet has a minor difference regarding to a new property "selector" that allows to consider other PODs already created

Scaling
There're 4 ways to do it:
    1.- Updating the file and then run:
        kubectl replace -f <replicaset-file.yaml>
    2.- By using the command line:
        kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f <replicaset-file.yaml>
    3.- Using the command line:
        kubectl scale --replicase=6 replicaset <replica-name>
    4.- Editing the default yaml file
        kubectl edit replicaset <replicaset-file>

ReplicaSet scenarios:
- If a POD gets deleted, intencionally for example, replicaset will raise another one POD
- If there are 3 replicas running and then another POD with same label gets started, replicaset will terminate it and keeps it waiting

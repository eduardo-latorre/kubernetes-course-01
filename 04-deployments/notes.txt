Deployments:

- It's a one step higher in the hierarchy of POD -> REPLICASET -> DEPLOYMENT
- It uses pretty much the same template as replicaset

Deployment Rollout and versioning:

- When there's a new update in deployment, it triggers a Rollout, and name it revision 1,2,3...10
    To update:
    - kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yaml
    - kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deployment / This is no recomemder since it won't be configured in the specification file
    To check:
    - kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment
    - kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment

- Deployment strategies:
    - Recreate: Destroying the old instances and launch new-one. The app won't be available during this process
    - Rolling update: Destroy instances one-by-one and launching the new one so the app remains available
